# Natural Language Processing and Spell Checking API
This is a Flask-based API that performs natural language processing (NLP) using the Spacy library and spell checking using the PySpellChecker library. The API takes a list of strings as input and returns the corrected spellings, the number of occurrences of the keyword in the text, the starting and ending index of the keyword in the text and the named entities found in the text.

Installation
Install the required libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the language model by running python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Run the program by executing python execute.py
